- **Bioresponse(RF and GB)** - predicting biological response of a molecule based on tabular data from [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bioresponse). Used and compared: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. Additionally, I explored the effect of the size of train data on the quality of models via learning_curve.
- **AE_MNIST** - implementing Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder architectures for reconstruction and generation handwritten digits from MNIST dataset.
- **AE_face_reconstruction** - implementing Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder architectures for face reconstruction and face generation. Dataset: [Labeled faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)
- **GAN_Flickr-Faces** - implementing GAN architecture for working with 512x512 faces from [Flickr-Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/flickrfaceshq-dataset-ffhq) dataset.
